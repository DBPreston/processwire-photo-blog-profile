# ProcessWire - FieldTypeRadio

This ProcessWire module produces a radio input that would allow you to define a list of options in the field's configuration from which to select a value.

After installing, you'll have a new "Radio" fieldtype that will allow you to define the items you'd like in the output. You'll be able to define these options in a text box on the field's configuration screen. Just put each option on it's own line.

This project was inspired and mostly written (with some customization) based off this project: https://github.com/Hani79/Processwire_FieldType_Select_Drop_Down
